TheTobinator: I need to make dinner now
TheTobinator: but now that I finished that Zelda I'll be around a bit more often and do some scripting ;)
Lolzifer: ok enjoy your meal
TheTobinator: thanks, you too
TheTobinator: see ya on Thursday!
Lolzifer: ok good, zelda magic game dev!
Lolzifer: seeyathen
TheTobinator: hey
Lolzifer: yo
TheTobinator: I wrote you a small mail
Lolzifer: k i'll go see
Lolzifer: k i'll update and put more spawn points on the map
TheTobinator: ok, cool
TheTobinator: next thing for me will be to fix that erratic circling when reaching destination points
TheTobinator: I guess both zombies and humans do that
Lolzifer: Watching the Unity Multipurpose Avatar tutorials, slow going
Lolzifer: ah yeah they maybe they need small list of points to go to? or someanimation to do
TheTobinator: they kind of walk around a few steps to "look around"
TheTobinator: but it doesn't work well as you can see ;)
Lolzifer: ah, I thought i had them going to barriers and boxes tags?
Lolzifer: I though they could search boxs and furniture for weapons
TheTobinator: yeah, we can bring such behaviour back
Lolzifer: and I think there's a "wood" tag that they could collect the wood, maybe I had another name for that ta
TheTobinator: do the zombies really spawn only upon clicking for you?
Lolzifer: seems like it
TheTobinator: they seemed to work here
Lolzifer: did the zombie spawn and seek a target?
Lolzifer: shoul seek the player first
TheTobinator: no, but they spawned with delays
TheTobinator: okay, that's a good idea
TheTobinator: just make them walk toward the player
Lolzifer: hm i'll let you know if that's changed when I grab the git
TheTobinator: ok
TheTobinator: well, there is only that one zombie at the moment in the udg level
TheTobinator: but you can add more spawn points
Lolzifer: yeah
Lolzifer: i added my small changes to the repository, removed two scripts tryign to stop key capture while editing, didnt' seem to make a difference, also 'fixed' some of the old models in the Quick City map, but that breaks them, doors stop being passable.
TheTobinator: alright, I'm updating
TheTobinator: oh, you added antack stuff ;)
Lolzifer: oh Norton freaked out about the last build of igame3d and threw it away the other day. I think it's the murgalua being able to spawn new processes that it didn't like, just FYI
Lolzifer: oh the old arcade games are on the repository, but they have some collision box issues in Unity 5
TheTobinator: ah, interesting
TheTobinator: I don' have norton or stuff like that installed
Lolzifer: yikes
TheTobinator: living the risky life ;)
Lolzifer: very
Lolzifer: it's saved my ass a few times, Amy's webroot anti-virus has found at least 17 things on her machine
TheTobinator: I can't tell if there are any viruses on this machine
TheTobinator: but nothing misbehaves so far
Lolzifer: if you don't surf much you'll probably be ok
TheTobinator: I don't use for web etc.
Lolzifer: ah ok, yeah nice and isolated
Lolzifer: ok looks like zombie auto spawns
TheTobinator: nice
TheTobinator: I'll make them walk towards the player next time
Lolzifer: groovy, think they do it now with a click, but F key is disabled?
Lolzifer: hmm only one is walkign
TheTobinator: click more often to activate more
TheTobinator: isn't it exactly like in the old version?
TheTobinator: you click somewhere -> one zombies has the task to walk there
TheTobinator: you click again -> another zombie also has the task to walk there
TheTobinator: and so on
Lolzifer: right, I clicked myself a few timse after they spawned only one guy moved, but clicking a human sent them both to them
TheTobinator: ah, okay
TheTobinator: probably a bug then
Lolzifer: ok its working
Lolzifer: maybe I missed the click
TheTobinator: we need some kind of indicator on the floor
Lolzifer: maaaaybe, probably
TheTobinator: as long as it doesn't look as bad as in the original ;)
Lolzifer: wasn't too bad, heh
TheTobinator: oh, by the way I reused some of the iGame3D OpenAL code for music playback in Royal Revolt
Lolzifer: nice
TheTobinator: for prototyping the musicplayer in the upcoming steam version
Lolzifer: iGame3D lives!
TheTobinator: hehe, it does!
TheTobinator: I think we release the Steam version this summer
Lolzifer: cool!
TheTobinator: will be free-to-play
Lolzifer: get those micro-transactions
Lolzifer: other gamers live a whole different world then old men like me
TheTobinator: yeah, this in-app-purchase thing is also not my thing
TheTobinator: but it brings in the money ;)
Lolzifer: good!
TheTobinator: we outsourced the development of the steam version to cliffhanger from Austria
TheTobinator: but well... I need to clean up their shit all the time
Lolzifer: shit
TheTobinator: and support them
TheTobinator: it's just a waste of time and money
Lolzifer: damn
TheTobinator: should have done all that in-house
Lolzifer: something to learn from when you are calling the shots
TheTobinator: hehehe, yes
Lolzifer: you bring them all in house, keep them in some rented apartment, no light, food under the door
Lolzifer: Like Unity started
TheTobinator: buckets with fish heads and coke
Lolzifer: hah
TheTobinator: oh, did you see "Portal Knights" by the way?
TheTobinator: it's done by my former Sacred 3 coworkers
TheTobinator: also available on Steam
Lolzifer: haha
TheTobinator: is working out quite nicely
Lolzifer: looking at it now
TheTobinator: has a nice trailer
TheTobinator: might be something for you, has minecraft elements
TheTobinator: just loooks better
Lolzifer: yeah looks real nice
Lolzifer: I kind of burned out on the minecrafting thing, Still blows my mind that I was saying we should do that kind of thing at the very start of T3D
Lolzifer: I evem saw a castle map somewhere that looked an awful lot like our old castle level, only they were showing off real time lighting
TheTobinator: yeah, I guess you played a lot of minecraft back then ;)
Lolzifer: none
Lolzifer: Blockstorm
Lolzifer: shootin each other and digging holes
TheTobinator: oh, okay
Lolzifer: but then the player base dwindled to almost nothing
Lolzifer: and they nerfed my explosives, assholes
TheTobinator: hahahaha
Lolzifer: Laying claymores was so much fun
TheTobinator: oh, and next month "Olympus Rising" is launching
Lolzifer: maybe we can make a claymore style trap for zombies, where they play dead and pounce on someone walking by
TheTobinator: which started basically as a reskin of Royal Revolt II
TheTobinator: but has evolved
Lolzifer: heh, same company?
TheTobinator: yes!
TheTobinator: but only mobile versions for now
TheTobinator: they make it in the room next door
Lolzifer: well if you can reuse code to get a different audience, why not?
TheTobinator: absolutely
TheTobinator: it might sell
Lolzifer: Fallout 3/Skyrim for example
Lolzifer: or was it Skyrim/Fallout 4
TheTobinator: I didn't do much for it, just add some ad sdk
Lolzifer: padding your CV
Lolzifer: never say you did't do much :D
TheTobinator: hahaha, well, for that project it's ture
TheTobinator: true
TheTobinator: but I'm doing still a lot for RR2
TheTobinator: updates are planned for until 2017
TheTobinator: last month there was a big Apple and Google feature
Lolzifer: It's a succesful game, that's super fortunate in this market
TheTobinator: 1 million dollars revenue
Lolzifer: omg
TheTobinator: 100k just from people watching video ads in 30 days
Lolzifer: wtf!
TheTobinator: yes, we are lucky
TheTobinator: it's quite big in the mobile market
TheTobinator: but that was of course an outstanding month because of the featuring
TheTobinator: normally it's about the half which is still good
Lolzifer: makes up for Sacred 3 I guess
TheTobinator: yeah, basically it allowed the others to make Portal Knights
TheTobinator: the companies are still somewhat connected
Lolzifer: Oh the did it in house? thought they went independent
TheTobinator: well, they are still keen
TheTobinator: I went to keenflare
TheTobinator: which does mobile only as a joint venture with flaregames
Lolzifer: ah
TheTobinator: complicated ;)
Lolzifer: yah, need a map
TheTobinator: there are like 4 different companies which were once one
Lolzifer: org chart
TheTobinator: hahaha
Lolzifer: that's good, at least if lay offs hit they don't just dump the whole lot
Lolzifer: you guys are doing good though, maybe we should reskin RR for UDG?
TheTobinator: hehehe, actually such a thing was in progress for a short time
Lolzifer: oh yeah?
TheTobinator: internal name was just "Zombies"
TheTobinator: it was also Tower Defense-ish
Lolzifer: and what happened? too many similar games?
TheTobinator: I think they just experimented around in between Royal Revolt I and II
TheTobinator: I wasn't in the company back then
TheTobinator: but it probably is still on svn ;)
Lolzifer: hmm
Lolzifer: maybe when we have a more accurate version of UDG you can pitch it
TheTobinator: we should figure out decent mobile input for it
TheTobinator: which well, could work
Lolzifer: yeah have to work out how the game should 'really' play
TheTobinator: tapping of course works like clicking, and for the few keyboard controlled things we add some big enough on-screen buttons
Lolzifer: FPS seems natural but leaves out some of the immersion or sense that you have control, RTS pulls you way out of the immersion, third person is neat but doesn't make sense unless we use some grim reaper type model maybe
Lolzifer: there is some game on Steam where ou are running around in first person, killing multiplayer people, by throwing zombie pheremones at them that attract the zombies
Lolzifer: basically plucked right out Dying Light zombie mode, and actually our origina uDeadGame design doc
TheTobinator: absolutely!
Lolzifer: I was thinking, what if you udeadgame is multiplayer
Lolzifer: like hungry hungry hippoes, eat the most humans
TheTobinator: hm, does Unity make Multiplayer easy?
Lolzifer: apparently so, not sure how 'easy' is, but for now keep it in mind
Lolzifer: you played Agar.io?
TheTobinator: no, let me google that
Lolzifer: dots eat dots, get bigger, expend mass for speed, multiplayer online thing
TheTobinator: ah, I know it
TheTobinator: just not by that name
Lolzifer: We could do a similar thing with zombies
Lolzifer: make a zombie get fatter...eventually explode
Lolzifer: exploding zombies is like a staple of the genre now
TheTobinator: the enlargement of the zombies would be very limited in that level there though ;)
TheTobinator: small hallways
Lolzifer: yeah only their guts would get big
Lolzifer: might be able to do that with UMA
TheTobinator: hehehe, could try that, yeah
TheTobinator: does that also come with some animations?
Lolzifer: I don't think so
TheTobinator: ok
Lolzifer: I hope they are rigged, didn't test that ye
TheTobinator: because that eating anim we are using is... you know
Lolzifer: We have crazy amounts of animations
Lolzifer: yeah...well could buy the zombie animations for like $10
Lolzifer: just don't want our open soure repository to be cluttered with cash objects yet
TheTobinator: that's right
TheTobinator: we shouldn't do that yet
Lolzifer: there was some motion capture software for sale a few months back, for som reason I had a feeling UNity was going to add MoCap to the engine...maybe I dreamed that
TheTobinator: ha
TheTobinator: well, getting mocap data into unity isn't so hard when you it
TheTobinator: when you have it I mean
Lolzifer: after dealing with 100s of animations I was not too excited to do my own motion capture data tweaking
TheTobinator: I bet
Lolzifer: we'll just scrounge along for now, and then 'polish' it later
TheTobinator: let's just rotate that current eating anim by 90 degrees
TheTobinator: ;)
Lolzifer: ha!
TheTobinator: alright, I think I'll be around on Monday and do some minor scripting then
Lolzifer: ok see you then, have a good weekend
TheTobinator: will spend the weekende at my parents
TheTobinator: thanks, you too!
TheTobinator: enjoy
Lolzifer: have fun!
TheTobinator: cu
