# Texture-Creator
Texture Creator is a simple unity editor extension to create the different maps you need for the standard shader from a single picture. 

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/Staross/Texture-Creator/archive/master.zip) or clone the repository and copie the files into your Asset folder. The tool is then found under `Window->TextureCreator`.

## Usage

You can select an image into the Load panel. I keep my source images into a folder, they can have any size. The value of the different panel parameters are saved automatically for each source image into `Assets/TextureCreator/Save/`. These can be deleted at any point if not needed.

For each panel the texture can be written to disk using the write button at the top. The textures are saved into `Assets/Textures/`. If a material has been created in the Load panel, textures will be automatically assigned to it.
