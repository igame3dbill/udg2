-- begin chat transcript
Tobi: rock uDG ?
Bill: dunno
Bill: don't have a game plan for udg
Tobi: me neither
Tobi: but would be cool
Bill: I think we could enter a zombies FPS
Tobi: right!
Tobi: it's also easier to code than the ZGS
Bill: yeah I bet
Tobi: basically most stuff is already there
Tobi: your level shows it
Bill: yeah we maybe make the level smaller, tighter...its really big for the cars right now, if they aren't being used can squeeze things
Tobi: right, and some interior level would be cool too
Bill: I was thinking we have the humans follow the fps camera as if they had been given an order to stand somewhere
Tobi: protect your house or something
Bill: yeah interior levels I was thinking maybe when we contact outdoor buildings, we go to a new level which would be indoor
Tobi: thats cool
Tobi: how much time do you have?
Bill: a bunch-ish
Tobi: awesome
Tobi: so maybe we can do 5 levels
Tobi: or at least 4
Bill: how much time do you have?
Tobi: its holidays, so plenty of time until january 4th
Bill: oh did you see how funny it is when the zombies eat your invisible feet
Tobi: haha, no
Bill: its like they bow down to worship you
Tobi: omg
Tobi: hehe, yes, its hard to make those zombie animations really evil
Bill: hmm what if we do reverse FPS, we just move around the camera..and all the zombies are attracted to the camera..so whatever human we follow around gets ganged up on
Tobi: hehehe, I like the idea
Tobi: could be the zombie master
Bill: oh the zombies are cool, its just we should use a person model instead of a box for the camera hook
Bill: we should try that idea
Tobi: sounds fun!
Bill: we can start with one zombie...find a victim..make two zombies
Tobi: thats good
Bill: of course that is if the person doesn't run away
Tobi: for that the humans need "safe places"
Tobi: you'll always catch them otherwise
Bill: well they should run
Tobi: yeah, they should run
Bill: we should catch a few off guard though
Tobi: and zombies should run as well
Bill: add a surprise factor
Bill: not all zombies run
Bill: its scarier if a few just mope
Tobi: okay, thats true
Bill: the slow ones might survive by the time the humans run out of ammo
Tobi: but the player himself is no zombie?
Bill: nope
Bill: just the zombie "sense"
Tobi: good
Tobi: should we use the fps movement for the zombie sense?
Bill: yeah
Bill: maybe "shooting" should mark our victim?
Tobi: ah, thats an idea
Tobi: alright, I think we can use most of the ZGS scripts
Tobi: except for the giving orders
Bill: right
Bill: fps loads all zgs scripts right now
Tobi: excellent
Bill: then loads a few of its own
Tobi: good starting point
Bill: so the game func is different
Tobi: okay, might need to add parts from zgs' game func later
Bill: yeah, some parts are in there, like getting people to walk around and zombies that eat people etc
Bill: the people are dumb though
Tobi: the level is certainly too big
Tobi: where should it start? a morgue? graveyard?
Tobi: morgue would be very cool
Tobi: some corpse wakes up and eats doctors and nurses
Tobi: then out on the streets
Bill: yeah thats good
Bill: a* shouldn't be a problem indoor?
Tobi: right
Tobi: it needs some improvements anyway though
Tobi: we might need to implement a* in the engine to make it faster
Tobi: and find a way to interface that from within lua
Tobi: okay, question is.... Do we need a design document this time?
Bill: We should
Bill: But I think you can wing it
Tobi: wing it?
Bill: make it up as you script
Tobi: ah, alright
Tobi: what might be important is to decide on which levels we want to do
Bill: the basics: zombies are attracted to camera area, will feed on humans nearbye, humans turn to zombies, humans shoot at zombies, humans run from zombies, humans hide in houses(?)
Tobi: a level ends when no humans are left?
Bill: yeah...
Tobi: ok, sounds obvious
Tobi: you had this quad maker fluid
Tobi: could use it for some interior testing level
Bill: yeah its still in the fluid folder
Tobi: nice
Bill: cubemapper
Tobi: then we need a working title for this game
Bill: udeadgame
Tobi: lol
Tobi: perfect

I  forgot to take a chat transcript from July 10,2015, it went like this:
Tobi: I'm trying Unity, it's amazing  
Bill: Finally! Yeah it can do everything.  
Tobi: We should remake uDeadGame in it.  
Bill: Yes we should.  

Exciting game developer stuff.
